Simulation of quadrotor safely navigating through a complex environment with obstacles to reach a target. Implementing non-linear geometric tracking controller and A* algorithm (L_2 heuristic). Results validated in lab with a Crazyflie 2.0 quadrotor and Vicon (video available).

This project was conducted for the purposes of MEAM-620 (project 1) at Upenn.

Python scripts require cvxopt, matplotlib, numpy, scipy, timeout_decorator (see 'setup.py'). Run 'sandbox.py'. Visualization/animation of simulation available.
